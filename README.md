# MySQL Index Optimization Scripts

These scripts help in analyzing a MySQL database for potential index improvements and then create the suggested indexes to enhance performance.

## Overview

The project consists of two Bash scripts:

1. **`index_analysis.sh`**: This script analyzes the structure of a MySQL database and suggests indexes that could improve query performance. The suggested indexes are saved in a file named `index_creation_commands.sql`.

2. **`create_indexes.sh`**: This script reads the `index_creation_commands.sql` file generated by `index_analysis.sh` and executes the SQL commands to create the suggested indexes in the database.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- **MySQL Client**: The MySQL command-line client (`mysql`) should be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
- **Bash**: These scripts are written in Bash, so a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL) is required.

## How to Use

### 1. Index Analysis Script

**Script**: `index_analysis.sh`

This script connects to your MySQL database, analyzes its tables, and suggests indexes for columns that are not part of a primary key and do not already have an index.

#### Usage

```bash
./index_analysis.sh -h <host> -P <port> -u <user> -p <password> -d <database> -x <prefix>
